    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1>
        This wild raspberry mousse is light as air, slightly sweet, and very berry-forward. 
    </p1>
    <p>
        If black raspberries are difficult to find, red raspberries or blackberries make an excellent substitute.

        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place raspberries, maple syrup, lemon juice, lemon zest, and salt in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring often, until berries begin to burst and release their juices; about 10 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Place a fine mesh sieve over a medium bowl. Pour berry mixture into the sieve. Using the back of a wooden spoon or spatula, press firmly on the mixture to release as much of the juice as possible. Discard seeds. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Place gelatin and cold water into a small bowl and allow gelatin to bloom for 5 minutes. Add gelatin to the saucepan the berries were in, and heat over low heat, stirring often, until gelatin is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour strained berry juice back into the pan with gelatin, and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until just beginning to simmer. Remove from heat, and stir in yogurt until completely smooth and combined. Let mixture cool to room temperature. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat cream and vanilla together In a large bowl until cream holds stiff peaks. Stir 1/4 of whipped cream into cooled berry mixture, then fold berry mixture into remaining whipped cream until smooth and combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour mousse into serving containers. Cover lightly with plastic wrap; refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours to overnight.
